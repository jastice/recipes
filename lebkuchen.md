# Justin's Lebkuchen

A variation of Elisenlebkuchen, which contain no flour.
Makes ca 45-60 Lebkuchen, 7cm.

Vegan, gluten-free (with the right kind of oblaten), certainly not low-fat or low-sugar.

## Primary ingredients

* 900g nuts or similar. Preferred mixture: 
  * 200g coconut
  * 200g hazelnut
  * 200g almonds
  * 300g cashews
* 600g (brown) sugar
* 300g raisins and/or dried plums
* 150g linseeds + 450ml water (or 10 eggs)
* 50ml rum
* 1/2 lemon, juice and peel shaving
* 5g potassium carbonate (Pottasche)
* lots of Oblaten

## Spice mixture 
(most of them non-powdered, if possible)

* 20g cinnamon (powder)
* 4g ginger (powder)
* 1-2 vanilla beans (or some aroma I guess)
* 1g star anis
* 3g allspice (piment)
* 2g cloves
* 4g black pepper
* 1g cumin
* 1g black cumin
* 3g nutmeg
* 3g cardamom


## Preparation

### The linseeds

1. Grind to fine powder
2. mix with water
3. let it sit while you do the other stuff

### The spices

1. smash the whole spices to chunky bits with mortar
2. roast the whole spices a little in a pan or so
3. grind them to powder and mix

### The nuts

* Grind all the nuts, ideally so they have mixed grain size (from powder to tiny chunks)

### The raisins/dried plums

* Grind or smash or smoosh them to a pulp


### Finally

1. Mix it all up well
2. spread it on oblaten
3. bake around 25-30 minutes at 170 C (convection)

## Notes

* I recommend a food processor, mill or high-power blender for grinding the nuts and raisins (I use a Vitamix)
* You can probably just use pre-ground nuts and spices for everything without too much loss of flavor.
* Most nut mixtures will work, but the texture may vary.
* The lemon is necessary to activate the potassium carbonate. You can substitute it with lime or some other acid.
* The "dough" is easier to spread evenly on the oblaten if you dip your fingers in water before.
